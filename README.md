Automated Hybris Install

Some scripts to automate the deployment of the base installation, plus enable connectivity to an external MySQL database.
Aditionally, a .service file to enable normal Systemd operation for Hybris, which enable the application to be started and stopped as you would a normal service.

NOTE: This is a Proof of Concept project and it should be treated as such.
